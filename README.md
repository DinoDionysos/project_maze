solve_maze_with_bfs.py creates a maze, solves it with bfs and shows the path that it found
solve_maze_with_dfs.py creates a maze, solves it with dfs and shows the path that it found

solve_maze_with_bfs_visualized.py creates a maze, solves it with bfs and visualizes every step the algorithm takes in a GUI
solve_maze_with_dfs_visualized.py creates a maze, solves it with dfs and visualizes every step the algorithm takes in a GUI

time_measurement.py lets dfs, bfs and ca solve a maze an measurese the time needed. Then shows the solution of each.
